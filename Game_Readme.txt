(Available in-game, but maybe more readable here)

MOVEMENT

(arrows) Move
(space)  Wait a turn (recover HP and Fatigue)
(tab)    Inspect things you can see
(enter)  Move toward or attack the selected thing
(i)      Inspect an item in your inventory.
(r)      Wait until you see an enemy or you're fully healed.
         There's no food clock, so there is no penalty for doing this.
(q)      Save and exit to the title screen

ITEMS

(d) Drop an item from your inventory, and pick up the item on the ground, if
    there is one and it fits

Items are automatically picked up as you move, unless they won't fit in your
inventory.

EQUIPMENT

(e) Equip or unequip weapons and armor

You have one weapon slot and 3 armor slots (head, body, hands). Never mind
about legs, they're not important.

COMBAT

(arrows/hjkl)  Bump into enemies to attack them with MELEE weapons.
(tab, mouse)   Select an enemy for a ranged attack
(enter, click) Attack the selected enemy with your wielded ranged weapon
(a)            Use a health boost
(s)            Use a stim (reset fatigue)

Combat costs FATIGUE. If you get too fatigued, you lose a turn after fighting.

Some weapons (mostly ranged) have a COOLDOWN. While a weapon is cooling down,
you will attack with your fallback weapon, i.e. your fists.

Ranged weapons are only 33% accurate at point blank range.

Cheats for Reviewers
--------------------

If you're finding it too hard, or you're impatient and want to beat the game,
you can use these cheats:

Shift+1: Omniscience
Shift+2: Invincibility (at 0 hp, you refill to full hp)

How to Win (SPOILERS)
---------------------

Kill everyone on the first level and take their items. Equip the guards'
armor and wield the tiny laser.

On the second level, carefully open doors until you find some evil doctors
and nurses. Kill them all and equip a lab coat, and maybe some gloves if
you got them. Now you have an OK melee weapon (scalpel, bone saw).

From here on out, a build that works is:

* Shock baton
* Some kind of good ranged weapons
* SWAT helmet or other headgear
* Tactical vest, rubber jacket, laserproof jacket in your inventory;
  swap based on the enemy's weapons

Counter ranged weapons with ranged. Counter melee with melee. Use the
enemy's fatigue to your advantage; they are much dumber than you about
waiting instead of shooting, and they don't have stims.
